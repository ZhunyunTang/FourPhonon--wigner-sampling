# A Fourphonon Package: Merged from the Wigner and Sampling Branches

## $\color{RED}{\rm{Notably}}$: the modified version will additionally output the diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the thermal conductivity for each mode

Diagonal term: ThConductivityMode_fre

Off-diagonal terms: ThConductivityCohMode_fre

Drawing code (mode thermal conductivity contribution for off-diagonal terms): plot-off-diagonal.py
